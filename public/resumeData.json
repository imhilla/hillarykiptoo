    "bio": "Hi there! I am Hillary! You might also call me Kiptoo. I've been coding for over 2 years now. As a Full Stack developer and a Freelancer. I've worked with clients to help build & scale their applications. Before that, I had worked as a Political scientist and a Farmer specifically growing onions. My passion for software development started while in my third year, doing my Bachelors’s degree. With this passion, I joined Microverse where I gained tremendous skills in React, Redux, HTML and CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails. Through pair programming and live coding sessions, I have accumulated several portfolio projects demonstrating how to apply developer skills in a range of cool builds and challenges. ",
